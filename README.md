Multi-Agent Customer Support Automation with CrewAI
This project demonstrates a multi-agent system for automating customer support interactions using the CrewAI framework. By leveraging the power of autonomous AI agents, it aims to provide efficient, accurate, and personalized support to customers.

Key Features :

Role-Playing Agents: 

Each agent has a distinct role (e.g., Senior Support Representative, Support Quality Assurance Specialist) with specific goals and backgrounds, enhancing the realism and effectiveness of interactions.

Task-Oriented Workflow:

The system utilizes a task-based approach, where agents collaborate to resolve customer inquiries through clearly defined steps.
CrewAI Tools: Leverages CrewAI's built-in tools (e.g.ScrapeWebsiteTool) to gather information from the web and internal documentation.

Memory and Context:

The system maintains conversation history, enabling agents to reference previous interactions and provide consistent responses.

Quality Assurance:

A dedicated agent ensures the quality and accuracy of responses before they are delivered to the customer.
How It Works

Customer Inquiry: 

A customer submits a question or request for support.

Task Assignment: 

The CrewAI framework assigns the inquiry to the appropriate agent (e.g., Senior Support Representative).

Information Gathering: 

The agent uses available tools and resources to research and gather relevant information.

Draft Response:

The agent generates a draft response to the customer's inquiry.

Quality Assurance: 

The Support Quality Assurance Specialist reviews the draft response for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to standards.

Final Response: 

The refined response is delivered to the customer.

Getting Started

Python 3.x
CrewAI library (pip install crewai crewai_tools langchain_community)
OpenAI API key (set as an environment variable)

Installation:

Clone this repository.
Install the required dependencies.

Configuration:

Update the utils.py file (if present) to include your OpenAI API key or Cohere or ani Large Language Model Api Key.

Future Enhancements

Integrate with CRM: 

Connect the system with your CRM to access customer data and history.
